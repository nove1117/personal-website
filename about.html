        <p>My journey is fueled by a deep desire to make my parents proud. Despite not having the wealth that others may have, I have never allowed that to stop me from dreaming big. I work tirelessly to provide for my family and improve our circumstances. Every step I take is a testament to my commitment to create a better future for those I love.</p>
        <p>In my academic journey, I also run an online selling business as my side hustle. This venture teaches me the values of hard work, perseverance, and entrepreneurship. While life may not always be easy, I remain focused on my dreams and continue to pursue success with every opportunity I have.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a first-year college student studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS). My ultimate dream is to become a successful computer scientist, where I can contribute to the world through technology and innovation. I know the road ahead will be tough, but I’m determined to achieve my goals and turn my dreams into reality.</p>
        <p>Glynescence is not just my name—it’s a reminder that no matter where we come from, we have the power to rise above our limitations, dream big, and build the future we desire.</p>
